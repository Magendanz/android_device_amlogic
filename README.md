Device configuration for building TWRP on Amlogic reference boards

## Build notes:
- To get started with AOSP sources to build TWRP, check out the minimal manifest repo [here](https://github.com/minimal-manifest-twrp/platform_manifest_twrp_aosp/tree/twrp-11).
- To save space, a shallow clone is recommended.
- These device configurations should be built with the **twrp-11** branch.
- Copy this project to /device/amlogic/ directory.
